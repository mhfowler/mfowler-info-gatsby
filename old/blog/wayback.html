 <p>An image, captured by the wayback machine from 2009,
  of a website I made in highschool containing<br>
  now defunct links to songs I recorded in my family house's
  <br>closet (also containing the internet router and cleaning supplies),
  along with some<br>
  geometric broken image links from the album art I photo-shopped together from<br>
  heavily filtered images of things around my house:

 <p>My freshman and sophomore years of high school I didn’t have many friends &mdash; I spent a lot of time next to the router<br>making angsty electronic music. I kept a small MIDI keyboard and microphone on a fold-able table in the closet.</p>
 <p>I made hundreds of songs, and used iWeb (apple’s WYISWYG website maker) to make a website to ‘publish’<br>the music to. I spent hours photographing my dog,<br>and random plants and photo-shopping the images together into album art.<br>I put all the songs and album<br>art onto <a href="http://maximusfowler.com" target="_blank" rel="external">http://maximusfowler.com</a> and didn’t share the website or music with anyone. </p>
 <p>This last spring I looked up maximusfowler.com on the wayback machine and found three entries:<br>
  <img class="doc-image" style="max-width: 400px" src="http://mhfowler.github.io/notes-from-sfpc/static/wayback.png"></p>
 <p>I clicked through to Music.html and found the following remnant of a page from 2009:<br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090323231502/http://www.maximusfowler.com/maximusproductions/Music.html" target="_blank" rel="external">https://web.archive.org/web/20090323231502/http://www.maximusfowler.com/maximusproductions/Music.html</a></p>
 <p>Scrolling through the blue letters on the dark background, thinking about echoes<br>of a memory, of looking out the window of my bedroom at night, and an even more distant memory of barefoot stepping on a firecracker and crying, of<br>diving into a lake and passing through an unexpected cold patch of water.</p>
 <p>Perhaps these dark blue letters and empty boxes reverberate my childhood to me<br>more deeply than if all the pages of the site remained</p>
