The <a href="https://twitter.com/infinitewishing">@infinitewishing</a> twitter bot randomly
selects a new tweet that has the words "I Wish" in it every 3 minutes and retweets it.

The Infinite Wishing Well continuously prints @infinitewishing's real time feed into an acrylic wishing well filled with water.
