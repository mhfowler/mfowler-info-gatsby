        This is a page listing things which I am hoping to sell or give away.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you would like to pick something up (or all of it), please send me a message over sms, telegram or signal at +4915208151367,
        or send me an email at maxhfowler@gmail.com.

        I usually am available for things to be picked up in the morning before 10AM, from my apartment in Alt-Treptow, Berlin.
    </p>
    <p>
        These are things from past projects, still functional, but no longer needed, and I want them to find some use.

        ps, this site is dynamically generated from
        a folder of images where I keep track of
        the inventory of what I am giving away
        by taking a picture of each thing,
        and naming each file or folder with the name of the thing.
        when something is given away or sold, I move it into the sold folder,
        and it no longer appears on this site.
