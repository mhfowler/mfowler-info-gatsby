The origin of all maps is direct experience. Direct experience is a source of knowledge and energy which is always available and has no substitute.[^1] 

This is a piece of writing about my ongoing experiments into accessing this well, as a form of direct action against the unjust structures that mediate our experience of the world in so many ways. What are the pathways immediately around us that lead to information being transmitted into our eyes? What are the structures and motives of these pathways and what are their effects on us? What agency do we have in how we use them or avoid them? As has been often speculated, perhaps to dismantle injustice in the world, we must also work to dismantle it within ourselves and our immediate surroundings. ((()))

A little over a year ago, on November 18th, after drinking a large coffee, in a rare moment of unifying coherence, I decided that I would try to use a flip-phone for somewhere between three months and a year, along with keeping a journal of emotions that arose for me during the process, marking on a calendar any days where I caved and used my iPhone, building a robotic machine which physically childblocks your iPhone, and creating a collection of all the maps I drew for navigating the city while using the flip-phone.

According to the journal, on December 14th, I imagined titling this project The Origin Of Maps, here is my note from that day:

```
12/14/18 (friday)
thought of the title The Origin Of Maps
a reference to direct experience, where all maps, originally, come from 
by the time we see an address inputted into Google Maps, 
there have been many layers of mediation 
The Origin Of Maps invites a return to direct experience
using the flip phone, you have to think of who you want to text or call
like imagining a UI based on blank screen 
the only ideas that surface are the ideas that originate from you
```

I imagined that this “project” would also be a ritual in tribute to mindfulness. As a ritual, it doesn’t really make sense to talk about “success” or “failure”, its just doing something with an intention. 

From the more experimental perspective, in the past year, I experienced a variety of ups and downs, and its hard to say what can really be attributed to the phone.  

A recurring theme was that if I was feeling bad I tended to blame it on the flip-phone and be frustrated by the project, and if I was feeling good then I felt like the flip-phone was a great idea. 

This was my note from May 7th:

```
5/7/19 (tuesday)
speaking with petja about how when I am feeling bad I blame my phone 
(i am alienated, i have no friends etc.), 
but when I am feeling good 
my life feels full and it seems like I have no problem 
petja says “i have friends, i am doing ok”
```

Unfortunately, only the Auslanderbehorde (the German Foreigner’s office which grants Visas) is institutionally verified to really say if I’m doing OK or not. 

In the absence of their official opinion, I would like to leave that question for the wind to debate, and instead will share some of the documentation I made through this process.

Here are my journal entries from the first 10 days after I decided to use the flip-phone:

```
day 1 (sunday)
picked up rpi from kleinanzeigen and hung out with mylene 
missed on turn on the way to kleinanzeigen pickup, but used map in my bag to figure out where I had missed the turn (felt like my rope harness catching me from falling) 

day 2 (monday)
took my iphone with me because I wanted to use a weird app to text a drug dealer about buying weed which I thought was only available on iphone but turns out also has desktop version 

day 3 (tuesday)
took my iphone with me to studio because I was feeling like texting from the corner of the studio was nice
was feeling unsure about the project, and frustrated that people were having trouble understanding how I wanted to be reached 
in the evening left studio without my smart phone
felt rejuvenated by patty texting me updates to where the birthday party she was at was, even though we had been messaging before on telegram. she understood the system I wanted to use and laughed and told me it wasn’t that complicated 

day 4 (wednesday)
left my iphone at home in the morning 
felt excited about project in general as a way to provide some structure and direction to my life 
to frame a period of life as research and ritual 

day 5 (thursday)
felt good to only have flip-phone during the day and at night-time while returning to my apartment was excited to see what messages i had received on my iphone 

day 6 (friday)
using flip phone feels like gently scuba-diving away from my computer everyday
messaging during the day, it was not so difficult making plans for the weekend 

day 7 (saturday)
thought I had memorized directions, but realized I hadn’t memorized what to do after getting out of the u-bahn 
successfully navigated the final part by asking strangers on the street for directions  

day 8  (sunday)
dan says “you are really making life complicated… flip-phone, veganism”
he tells me he and a friend have been writing a song for fun with the lyrics
“gimme me vegan ramen… fuck u…. vegan doc martens…. fuck u…. Berghain (it used to be better)…. Sysyphous (it used to be better)…. About Blank (it used to be better)”

day 9 (monday)
catherine lost her computer while on vacation and spent a week without computer or phone
she says she feels a bit feral, but in a good way. I feel like I can also feel a difference 
she is dreaming of having no laptop, just having her computer be in a physical location where it is used. or of getting a job with her hands, becoming a cook 

day 10 (tuesday)
enjoyed getting coffee with Isaac, and baking a sweet potato for myself in the evening. not sure if this deserves to be in the journal or not, but it felt nice to buy a single sweet potato, and take it home and bake it and eat half of it for dinner (with rice and beans) and then eat the other half for breakfast the next day with eggs

Here is a zine I made in collaboration with Catherine Schmidt about the possibility of Disconnection Practices as healing practices:

I also wrote a bit about ups and downs I went through of wanting to “end the project” and go back to using my smart phone at different points, and how ultimately I “gave up” in May but then two days later I went back to using my dumb phone by choice and I didn’t feel as agitated anymore when it was now no longer part of an experiment but just something I was doing and could stop whenever I wanted. I then continued to use the dumb phone for the rest of the year until today (November 19, 2019) except for a period when I was in the US without a working sim card. I particularly look back highly on the first three months where I felt a lot of excitement and newness. In the months after that it mostly became routine, and the maps I drew became more and more cryptic and utilitarian. I may go back to using my smart phone, and I may also stop using it again in the future.

[^1]: As a short philosophical digression, one could argue that even our "direct" visual perception is mediated by culture and our past experience and so in some sense is also not direct. On the other hand, we all know the difference between hearing someone tell you what someone else said (a form of mediation) and hearing it directly. So like many philosophical questions, we can see that there is some ambiguity, but also like touching our nose with our finger there are lots of things we can do without knowing exactly how we do it.
