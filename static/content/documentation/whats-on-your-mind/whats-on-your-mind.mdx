*What's On Your Mind?* is a collection of writing posted on Facebook in the week after the November 8, 2016 election.

Project website: <a href="http://whats-on-your-mind.info">http://whats-on-your-mind.info</a>

We also distributed a physical zine of the statuses and organized a reading of the statuses at <a href="https://babycastles.com/">Babycastles</a> in New York on November 8, 2017.
