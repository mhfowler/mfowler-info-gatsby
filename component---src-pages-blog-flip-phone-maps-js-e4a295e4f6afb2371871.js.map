As a ritual, it doesn’t really make sense to talk about “success” or “failure”, its just doing something with an intention. In retrospect there clearly were ups and downs and I have no single conclusion. A recurring theme was that if I was feeling bad I tended to blame it on my phone, and if I was feeling good then I thought the flip-phone was a great idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was my note from May 7th:<br/>\n<br/>\n5/7/19 (tuesday)<br/>\nspeaking with petja about how when I am feeling bad I blame my phone (i am alienated, i have no friends etc.), but when I am feeling good my life feels full and it seems like I have no problem<br/>\npetja says “i have friends, i am doing ok”<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately, only the Auslanderbehorde is institutionally verified to really say if I’m doing OK or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the absence of their official opinion, I would like to side-step the question, and leave it for the board to review at a later performance review.<br/>\n<br/>\n—<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are my journal entries from the first 10 days after I decided to use the flip-phone:<br/>\n<br/>\nday 1 (sunday)<br/>\npicked up rpi from kleinanzeigen and hung out with mylene<br/>\nmissed on turn on the way to kleinanzeigen pickup, but used map in my bag to figure out where I had missed the turn (felt like my rope harness catching me from falling)<br/>\n<br/>\nday 2 (monday)<br/>\ntook my iphone with me because I wanted to use a weird app to text a drug dealer about buying weed which I thought was only available on iphone but turns out also has desktop version<br/>\n<br/>\nday 3 (tuesday)<br/>\ntook my iphone with me to studio because I was feeling like texting from the corner of the studio was nice<br/>\nwas feeling unsure about the project, and frustrated that people were having trouble understanding how I wanted to be reached<br/>\nin the evening left studio without my smart phone<br/>\nfelt rejuvenated by patty texting me updates to where the birthday party she was at was, even though we had been messaging before on telegram. she understood the system I wanted to use and laughed and told me it wasn’t that complicated<br/>\n<br/>\nday 4 (wednesday)<br/>\nleft my iphone at home in the morning<br/>\nfelt excited about project in general as a way to provide some structure and direction to my life<br/>\nto frame a period of life as research and ritual<br/>\n<br/>\nday 5 (thursday)<br/>\nfelt good to only have flip-phone during the day and at night-time while returning to my apartment was excited to see what messages i had received on my iphone<br/>\n<br/>\nday 6 (friday)<br/>\nusing flip phone feels like gently scuba-diving away from my computer everyday<br/>\nmessaging during the day, it was not so difficult making plans for the weekend<br/>\n<br/>\nday 7 (saturday)<br/>\nthought I had memorized directions, but realized I hadn’t memorized what to do after getting out of the u-bahn<br/>\nsuccessfully navigated the final part by asking strangers on the street for directions<br/>\n<br/>\nday 8  (sunday)<br/>\ndan says “you are really making life complicated… flip-phone, veganism”<br/>\nhe tells me he and a friend have been writing a song for fun with the lyrics<br/>\n“gimme me vegan ramen… fuck u…. vegan doc martens…. fuck u…. Berghain (it used to be better)…. Sysyphous (it used to be better)…. About Blank (it used to be better)”<br/>\n<br/>\nday 9 (monday)<br/>\ncatherine lost her computer while on vacation and spent a week without computer or phone<br/>\nshe says she feels a bit feral, but in a good way. I feel like I can also feel a difference<br/>\nshe is dreaming of having no laptop, just having her computer be in a physical location where it is used. or of getting a job with her hands, becoming a cook<br/>\n<br/>\nday 10 (tuesday)<br/>\nenjoyed getting coffee with Isaac, and baking a sweet potato for myself in the evening. not sure if this deserves to be in the journal or not, but it felt nice to buy a single sweet potato, and take it home and bake it and eat half of it for dinner (with rice and beans) and then eat the other half for breakfast the next day with eggs<br/>\n<br/>\n—<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is a zine I made in collaboration with Catherine Schmidt about the possibility of Disconnection Practices as healing practices:<br/>\n<br/>\ndisconnection-practices.pdf<br/>\n<br/>\n—<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI also wrote a bit about ups and downs I went through of wanting to “end the project” and go back to using my smart phone at different points, and how ultimately I “gave up” in May but then two days later I went back to using my dumb phone by choice and I didn’t feel as agitated anymore when it was now no longer part of an experiment but just something I was doing and could stop whenever I wanted. I then continued to use the dumb phone for the rest of the year until today (November 19, 2019) except for a period when I was in the US without a working sim card. I particularly look back highly on the first three months where I felt a lot of excitement and newness. In the months after that it mostly became routine, and the maps I drew became more and more cryptic and utilitarian. I may go back to using my smart phone, and I may also stop using it again in the future.<br/>\n<br/>\n__<br/><br/>\nExperimenting,<br/>\nM\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n  </Layout>\n)\n\nexport default FlipPhoneMaps\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
